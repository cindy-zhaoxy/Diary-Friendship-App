## Overview
### Description
Allows individuals at Stony Brook to write posts about their day and interests like a diary, with comments. Mainly geared towards improving the mental health of students. Has a chat function so that students can message one another. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking/ Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** This will be mainly a mobile app but would be viable on a computer as well, like most jouraling and social networking apps. 
- **Story:** Allows students to write posts that can be either private or public. User can then decide to message the user for moral support or even message to meet up in person. 
- **Market:** Made for Stony Brook University students, and try to keep it a safe environment. 
- **Habit:** The post function can be used as often as students want to log how their day went, or for students wanting to meet up. The chat function is not designed for a long term message platform. 
- **Scope:** First we would start having only SBU students be able to write posts, then perhaps this could evolve into a platform for other universities.
